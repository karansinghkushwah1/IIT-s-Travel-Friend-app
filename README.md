## Documentation and prerequisites
Connect to Firebase in android studio

* [Guide to add firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup)
* [Installation & Setup on Android](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/android/start)

1. Follow the official docs to connect Firebase and set up Android Studio
2. In the official docs, the editor used is Android Studio, but VSCode can also be used.

## Getting Started

A few resources to get you started and give a basic understanding with examples of how Firebase works:

- [Getting started](https://console.firebase.google.com/?pli=1)

For help getting started with Firebase, view [online documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs?authuser=0&hl=en), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Deployment

1. Open the whole folder in Android Studio.
2. It will detect that execution will begin building process.
3. Download an android emulator in the android studio or connect it to your phone(in debug mode) to run the app.
4. Copy .env.sample to .env
5. When the app builds for the first time it might take a while for it to get launched.
6. All the code that we have to work with is present in the srs folder.
7. To install any additional packages, first write its name under dependencies in file "AndroidManifest.xml". The packages will be installed.
8. To connect to Firebase , go to tools
9. The screens folder contains the basic layout of each individual page. We add more widgets and make up the UI of the page.
10. The widgets folder has individual widgets which can be used on multiple pages or are large in size and would reduce the readabilty and make a single page's code too long. 
11. Before making a pull request, format the code with `Ctrl+Alt+L`. Add a comma after all the closing brackets as it will help the IDE in aligning the brackets and formatting the code.
